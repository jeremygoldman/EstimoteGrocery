## EstimoteRegions
Project using Estimote iBeacons to simulate geofenced notifications w/ animations
*Note: EstimoteSDK is too large to upload to GitHub, so directory is incomplete*


i.e. Beacon 1 represents milk aisle, shows "You're in the milk aisle. Make sure you buy enough!"

Beacon 2 represents ice cream aisle, shows "You're in the ice cream section. Try the chocolate chip!"

Beacon 3 represents produce aisle, shows "You're in the ice cream section! Try the tomatoes, they're in season!"

# TODOs: 
  * Milk view: interface with grocery list or Reminders app to show how many are needed
  * Ice cream view: pull relevant deals/coupons on ice cream for advertising
  * Produce view: pull info from web about current fruits in season, display relevant in-season fruits
